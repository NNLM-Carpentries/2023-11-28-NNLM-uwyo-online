  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  We will use <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colaboratory</a>
    ("Colab") for this workshop.  In Colab, you can make notebooks
    within which Python code can be written and run. These notebooks will
    be saved to your Google Drive for you to access and share with others.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are familiar with Jupyter notebooks, working with a Colab notebook
    will feel very similar!
  </p>

  <p>To use Colab, you will need a <a href="https://www.google.com/account">Google account</a>.
    This can be an account attached to a Gmail address or another email address.
